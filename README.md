# Advent of Code 2020

![CI Status](https://github.com/zachtib/AdventOfCode2020/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Gradle/badge.svg?branch=main)

This is my git repository for 2020's Advent of Code, which I will
update until I get bored. Last year that was around day 5.

This is a simple Kotlin/Gradle project as I'm too lazy to go about
learning a new language this year. Everything is intended to be 
run directly from Intellij via `main()` functions.
